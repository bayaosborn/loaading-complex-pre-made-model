# loaading-complex-pre-made-model
Today I learnt how one can get info about a complex pre-model by calling model.summary()  to know what type of layers it was made of and what type of input shapes it requires. Also learnt how to dispose of the inputs, tensors and outputs and model so as to avoid a memory leak.
